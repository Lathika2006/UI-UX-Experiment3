# UI-UX-Experiment3
Heuristic Evaluation of an Existing Website or App

## Aim:
To conduct a heuristic evaluation of 2–3 competing websites or apps, identify usability issues using established UX principles, compare their strengths and weaknesses, 
and propose or develop design improvements to enhance overall user experience.

## Algorithm:
Step 1: Select Competing Apps or Websites
        Choose 2–3 apps/websites that offer similar services (e.g., Amazon vs Flipkart, Zomato vs Swiggy).
        Ensure they belong to the same category to make a meaningful comparison.

Step 2: Define Evaluation Criteria
        Use Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics as a framework:
        Visibility of system status
        Match between system and real world
        User control and freedom
        Consistency and standards
        Error prevention
        Recognition rather than recall
        Flexibility and efficiency of use
        Aesthetic and minimalist design
        Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
        Help and documentation

Step 3: Conduct the Heuristic Evaluation
        For each app/website:
        Interact with core user flows (e.g., browsing, login, checkout).
        Note down any usability issues under the relevant heuristics.
        Rate severity of each issue (e.g., Minor, Major, Critical).

Step 4: Compare UX of Apps/Websites
        Create a comparison table showing:
        Positive aspects of each app/website.
        Usability issues identified.
        Heuristics violated or followed.
        Analyze patterns in UX effectiveness across competitors.

Step 5: Propose Required Changes
        Based on evaluation, list key design improvements for each app/website:
        UI adjustments (e.g., button size, color contrast).
        UX enhancements (e.g., streamlined user flow, clearer error messages).
        Accessibility improvements (e.g., alt text, keyboard navigation).

Step 6: Develop or Illustrate the Improvements
        Use tools like Figma, Adobe XD, or Sketch to:
        Redesign selected screens or user flows.
        Apply the suggested changes visually.
        Ensure updated designs follow usability heuristics.

Step 7: Present and Review
        Share improved designs and findings with peers or users.
        Collect feedback to validate whether usability has improved.
        Iterate further if needed.
